This repository contains examples of microservices implemented using
[Goa](https://github.com/goadesign/goa). Each example focuses on a specific topic as indicated by
the directory name. The [cellar](https://github.com/goadesign/examples/tree/master/cellar) example
provides a complete implementation of a simple microservice.

As you study each example consider contributing back by providing better or more complete docs,
adding clarifying comments to code or fixing any error you may run across!
